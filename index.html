    <h1>Top 10 Best Venues to Play in St. Louis</h1>
    <div>
    <p class= "intro">As a musician in STL, over the years I've developed a list of my favorite
       venues<br> based on overall sound, not only for patrons but musicians, and atmosphere.<br>
       In no particular order, this is what I've come up with: </p>
    <nav>
       <ul>
         <li><a href="#off-broadway">Off Broadway</a>
         <li><a href="#the-ready-room">The Ready Room</a>
         <li><a href="#old-rock-house">Old Rock House</a>
         <li><a href="#delmar-hall">Delmar Hall</a>
         <li><a href="#foam">Foam</a>

          <p>Off Broadway is an intimate approx. 300 person venue that I love playing at.<br>
          The sound is always great, and the green room for artists is very eclectic and inviting.<br>
          Overall it just feels "cozy" and that's what I think I love most about it.<br>
          In fact, I love this venue so much it is where I've chosen to have my wedding this summmer!</p>

        <p>Anytime I play the Ready Room it feels like a party. The overall sound<br>
          and lighting are up to par with some of the bigger venues in STL (like the Pageant),<br>
          but the intimacy that I enjoy is still there with a capacity of 750. <br>
          So you get a good mix of national acts and local bands that play,<br>
          but no matter if I'm opening for someone or headlining, that party atmosphere is always there.<br></p>

        <p>Old Rock House is an "old" St. Louis Building that has had new life brought into it.<br>
        It's a very unique building that is almost shotgun style, so no matter where you are<br>
        in the building, you can see the stage. This is another venue that provides a good mix<br>
        of national and local acts headlining, but it bridges the gap between the Ready Room's<br>
        party atmosphere and Off Broadway's cozy vibe. Which makes it unique in its own way.<br>

      <p>Delmar Hall is one of the most "professional" feeling venues I've<br>
        had the opportunity to play in. The company that owns it also owns the<br>
        Pageant so some of that atmosphere rubs off in this space. As a local musician<br>
        I rarely feel special, but this place made me feel as such. The green <br>
        room/backstage area lets you completely escape, which can be nice. <br>
        The crew and sound engineers are also really easy to work with and <br>
        very talented. Overall a great experience every time.

      <p>On the complete opposite side of the coin from Delmar Hall, Foam<br>
        is an extremely intimate venue in a catagory all on its own. <br>
        During the day, they're a coffee shop/bar. Serving up your favorite<br>
        lattes and drinks (and sometimes combining the two). But at night<br>
        it becomes a music venue. I love playing shows there because there<br>
        is truly no other place like it in St. Louis.

           Atomic Cowboy</a></figcaption>
       </figure>
       <p>Atomic Cowboy is essentially 4 places in one: a restaurant, <br>
         a night club, and 2 music venues. There is an indoor and an outdoor <br>
         stage, providing for two completely different experiences. The indoor<br>
         stage is great for smaller shows, where the outdoor stage shines (no pun <br>
         intended) in the sunlight. Both are great places to play and see a show.<br>
         And it being in the heart of the Grove, it definitely brings a party<br>
         atmosphere as well.

        </figure>
        <p>The Duck Room is located in the basement of Blueberry Hill in the<br>
          Delmar Loop. It was owned by the late Chuck Berry, so playing on that<br>
          stage is like playing on hallowed ground.

         </figure>
         <p>CBGB is another very unique place in St. Louis. It is the <br>
           dive-iest of dive bars and playing there means cramming your<br>
           band and all equipment in what feels like a 4ft by 4ft space.<br>
           That aside,I've played some of my absolute favorite shows there<br>
           The energy is unmatched by any other venue I've played.

          </figure>
          <p>The Heavy Anchor is a solid venue that is gaining some popularity<br>
            and it rightfully deserves it. The way the venue is set up makes it always<br>
            feel full (which helps boost my little musicians ego). Also, the bar and <br>
            venue side are separated by an indoor garage door, which my millenial <br>
            side LOVES.
